- is my Hand::deal_from(deck) method actually taking cards out of the deck?

  actually when we call deck.take, we are not calling the normal array.take function that doesn't actually remove things from an array

- tie, will have to split pot between tie players

- might want to rig the deck and players in a test file to make sure ties and splits the money properly

  or just don't shuffle
